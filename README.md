🎬 Cinema Database Management System
📌 Introduction
The Cinema Database Management System is a relational database solution developed to streamline and automate cinema hall operations. In today's fast-paced environment, efficiency, speed, and accuracy in managing movie schedules, bookings, and infrastructure are crucial. Manual processes often result in delays, errors, and inefficiencies.

This system addresses those challenges by organizing data into structured tables with clearly defined relationships, enabling real-time and reliable data access. Core operations include:

Adding new movies

Assigning screens

Scheduling shows

Registering customers

Managing bookings

Generating analytical reports (e.g., revenue, seat availability, booking history)

By adopting a database-driven approach, cinema administrators can enjoy smoother workflows, better customer experiences, and improved decision-making.

🧠 Techniques Used
The system is primarily built using MySQL, an open-source relational database management system. The following techniques have been applied:

Entity-Relationship Modeling for visualizing data structures

Normalization to reduce redundancy and organize data

SQL Queries for data manipulation and retrieval

Constraints such as PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY for data integrity

Joins to combine related data from multiple tables

Aggregate Functions for summarizing and analyzing data

Filtering and Sorting to extract actionable insights

Stored Procedures & Views (optional enhancements) for automation

This system simulates a real-time environment with multiple users accessing and modifying data concurrently.

🖥️ System Configuration

Component	Specification
Operating System	Windows 10+, Linux, or macOS
Database Software	MySQL or PostgreSQL
RAM	Minimum 4GB
Processor	Intel i3 or equivalent and above
Tools	MySQL Workbench, DBeaver, phpMyAdmin
📥 Inputs
To simulate cinema operations, the system accepts inputs including:

🎞️ Movie details (title, genre, release date)

🏢 Theater details (name, location)

🪑 Screen details (screen number, seat capacity)

📅 Show schedule (date, time, movie, screen)

👤 Customer details (name, email, phone)

🎟️ Booking details (seats booked, total amount)

🔗 Entity-Relationship Diagram
The ER diagram defines the entities and their relationships in the system using one-to-many and one-to-one associations. This helps in normalizing data and avoiding redundancy.

Relationships

#	Relationship Type	Parent Table	Child Table	Foreign Key	Description
1	One-to-Many	Theaters	Screens	TheaterID	One theater can have multiple screens
2	One-to-Many	Screens	Shows	ScreenID	One screen can host multiple shows
3	One-to-Many	Movies	Shows	MovieID	One movie can be shown in multiple shows
4	One-to-Many	Customers	Bookings	CustomerID	One customer can make multiple bookings
5	One-to-Many	Shows	Bookings	ShowID	One show can have multiple bookings
6	One-to-One	Bookings	Customers	BookingID	One booking is linked to one customer
🗂️ Database Schema (Tables)

Table Name	Primary Key	Foreign Keys	Description
Movies	MovieID	—	Stores movie information
Theaters	TheaterID	—	Stores theater information
Screens	ScreenID	TheaterID	Screens in each theater
Shows	ShowID	ScreenID, MovieID	Movie schedules
Customers	CustomerID	—	Stores customer information
Bookings	BookingID	CustomerID, ShowID	Booking records
📜 SQL Queries
A total of 13 SQL queries are included in the project to:

Retrieve movie schedules

Count bookings per customer

Calculate total revenue

Check seat availability

Filter and sort data based on various conditions

(You can add specific SQL queries under this section if needed.)
